A Minecraft (Bedrock Edition) client written in C#

This is a hobby project i work on from time to time, the end goal being it able to connect to a MC:Bedrock server & be feature compatible with most features required for the typical minigame server.

It can currently render Anvil worlds with block and entity models imported from vanilla Minecraft.

Model rendering isn't yet quite perfect, but a lot of models can be rendered already!
